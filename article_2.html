        <p>A bit of a backstory on this vehicle: I bought this car in June of 2022. The engine in it had rod knock. I wanted to go with a different option
        than the EJ25D that was in it, hence the search began. The car has been sitting for a year and a half now. Below is a list of items that
        I worked through to get this swap to work: </p>

        <p class="caption">Engine bay before starting work, went through and cleaned it with a fellow subaru owner over the summer. </p>

        <p>So, this is actually a nice straight forward swap &#40;unlike a lot of swaps out there&#41;. There are not many wiring
        hurdles that need to be overcome to get this to work. That is if you get the right engine. </p>

        <p>Got the engine. It has an unknown number of miles, at least that is what the scrap yard I got it from said. So that is definitely
        a little worrisome. This particular engine does have new cylinder heads though. These heads have hydraulic lifters, instead of solid style lifters. 
        Compression is apparently around 160psi per cylinder; turning the engine over by hand it certainly feels that way. The engine was coated in a thick,
        nearly immpenetrable layer of oil and dust. It didn't really help that I was used a primitive way of removing it; dabs of degreaser, plenty of rags, and the occassional
        sweet, sweet sip of la-croix. Below is a picture of the beauty:</p>

        <img src="images/engine.jpeg" alt="Picture of the engine" class="actual-image">
        <p>This is the engine that I going back in the car, single overhead cam instead of dual overhead cam. </p>

        <p>First things first was finding all the tune up parts for this thing: spark plugs, spark plug wires, filters, belts, etc... These parts aren't
        really that expensive by themselves; once you start purchasing a lot of them that's when it becomes expensive. In addition to general tune up parts I also ended up getting some
        specialty parts; Most notably a new radiator and an exhaust manifold. Why a radiator you may ask? Well, I messed up the old radiator pretty good getting it out of the car, 
        severely bending some of the cooling fins. Hopefully I can come up witha better mounting solution for the radiator than chicken wire, which is what I purchased the car with. I ended
        up putting most of the <b>tune up</b> parts on with the engine out of the car for easier access to everything. Once this was done I could actually move onto slapping the engine
        in the car.</p>

        <p>Getting the engine in the car wasn't as easy as I thought it would be, I had some issues aligning the engine with the transmission mainly due to the fact that I didn't 
        have long enough chains. If I had longer chains then I would have been able to mount the leveler parallel crank pulley to flex plate, rather than parallel passenger to driver
        valve cover. I had to take off the intake manifold and secure the chains to intake manifold mounting points. There are 8 of these points, they are quite strong, and they
        are out on the edges of the engine giving you really better control of where you are directing the engine. Video of me struggling with the engine: https://www.youtube.com/@screeskier/videos
        The video also depicts my neandrathal way of intially hoisting the engine, two attachment points (one on the ac compressor bracket and the other near the bulkhead engine connectors.
        These points on the engine are strong but they also do not balance the weight that well.</p>
        
        <p>In the end I had to take the engine in and out of the car 4 times. This is just the nature of the game sometimes; Especially considering my current experience level with cars.
        Sure I've worked on them, but I only just started working on them seriously ~2 years ago. A couple of times the engine was spun in the wrong direction, another the engine mounting
        studs were not lining up with their slots, and the remaining two times the engine was obnoxiously tipping way too far forward... :| . Eventually though with enough patience 
        I was able to get it to a point where I could thread on two of the four bellhousing bolts. The bolts were only threaded on when the engine and transmission were ~.5 inches
        away from each other to prevent any unnecessary tangential forces on the fasteners.</p>
