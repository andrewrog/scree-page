        <p>So, this is actually a nice straight forward swap &#40;unlike a lot of swaps out there&#41;. There are not many wiring
        hurdles that need to be overcome to get this to work. That is if you get the right engine. </p>

        <p>Got the engine. It has an unknown number of miles, at least that is what the scrap yard I got it from said. So that is definitely
        a little worrisome. This EJ22 does have new cylinder heads though. These heads have hydraulic lifters, instead of solid style lifters. They
        are also single port exhaust, which means I had to pick up a new exhaust manifold. The previous engine in the car had dual port exhaust cylinder heads.
        Below is a picture of the engine (I worked on cleaning it up a little but it is still pretty dirty).</p>
