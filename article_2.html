        <p>A bit of a backstory on this vehicle: I bought this car in June of 2022. The engine in it had rod knock. I wanted to go with a different option
          than the EJ25D that was in it, hence the search began. The car has been sitting for a year and a half now, what could possibly go wrong?</p>

        <p>So, this is actually a nice straight forward swap &#40;unlike a lot of swaps out there&#41;. There are not many wiring
        hurdles that need to be overcome to get this to work. That is if you get the right engine. </p>

        <p>Got the engine. It has an unknown number of miles, at least that is what the scrap yard I got it from said. So that is definitely
        a little worrisome. This particular engine does have new cylinder heads though. These heads have hydraulic lifters, instead of solid style lifters. 
        Compression is apparently around 160psi per cylinder; turning the engine over by hand it certainly feels that way. The engine was coated in a thick,
        nearly immpenetrable layer of oil and dust. It didn't really help that I was used a primitive way of removing it; dabs of degreaser, plenty of rags, and the occassional
        sweet, sweet sip of la-croix. Below is a picture of the beauty:</p>

        <p>First things first was finding all the tune up parts for this thing: spark plugs, spark plug wires, filters, belts, etc... These parts aren't
        really that expensive by themselves; once you start purchasing a lot of them that's when it becomes expensive. In addition to general tune up parts I also ended up getting some
        specialty parts; Most notably a new radiator and an exhaust manifold. Why a radiator you may ask? Well, I messed up the old radiator pretty good getting it out of the car, 
        severely bending some of the cooling fins. Hopefully I can come up witha better mounting solution for the radiator than chicken wire, which is what I purchased the car with.</p>
